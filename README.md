# Solar System Simulation

An interactive 3D solar system simulation built with Three.js and GSAP. This project provides a visual representation of our solar system with interactive controls for planet speeds and additional features.

## Features

- 3D visualization of the solar system with all eight planets
- Interactive speed controls for each planet
- Pause/Resume functionality
- Dark/Light theme toggle
- Smooth animations using GSAP
- Responsive design

## Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (for development)

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- Three.js (3D graphics library)
- GSAP (Animation library)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the project files
2. No build process or dependencies to install - it's a pure frontend project

## Running the Project

1. Open the project folder in your preferred code editor
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser
   - You can do this by:
     - Double-clicking the `index.html` file
     - Using a local development server
     - Using the Live Server extension in VS Code

## Usage

### Controls

- **Planet Speed Controls**: Use the sliders to adjust the rotation speed of each planet
  - Mercury
  - Venus
  - Earth
  - Mars
  - Jupiter
  - Saturn
  - Uranus
  - Neptune

### Global Controls

- **Pause/Resume Button**: Toggle the animation of all planets
- **Theme Toggle**: Switch between light and dark themes

## Browser Compatibility

This project works best in modern browsers that support WebGL and ES6 features:
- Chrome (recommended)
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge

## Performance Tips

- If you experience performance issues, try:
  - Reducing the number of visible planets
  - Lowering the animation speeds
  - Using a more powerful device
  - Closing other resource-intensive applications
